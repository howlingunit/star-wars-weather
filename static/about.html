<p>This site uses a Raspberry Pi’s sense hat to record temperature data, this data will be compared to a planet in star wars. Since the raspberry pi is in a building (for now) the temperature won’t always reflect the outside temperature, however I’ve made the planets a lot warmer/cooler then they are in the universe far away so it might actually switch to them, so please don’t actually use this for telling the weather, also this is in the southern part of Hampshire so if you live in any other part of the world this would be fairly useless anyway.</p>
