# star-wars-weather
 
## Intro
This web app runs on a raspberry pi and uses the sense hat to find the temperature; it compares it to a planet from star wars. It is a node js app which runs a python file to gather the data. The client uses server polling to get live updates (this could be changed to web sockets).

This is in no way endorsed by star wars and has been done before, Tom Scott made one that has since been disabled, and the star wars app has a similar feature. I did this as I wanted to do something cool with the raspberry pi sense hat :)
